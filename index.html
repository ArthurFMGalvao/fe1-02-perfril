            <p>só um monte de palavra:
                <br>
                Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelingsBut I'm only going to get this one chance 
                <br>
                (six minutes-, six minutes-)Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
                <br>
                Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
                <br>
                If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
                <br>
                And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
                <br>
                You are just what the doc ordered

                I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
                <br>
                All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
                <br>
                Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
                <br>
                They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
